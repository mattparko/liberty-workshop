__Summary__

If you made it this far, first of all - congratulations!

Here's a quick recap of the things you just achieved:

* You deployed an Open Liberty application using an operator to manage all of the application's components as a single resource
* You used the Open Liberty operator's observability features by creating a Liberty dump and trace
* You built an application from source code and deployed it into the cluster, all with a single OpenShift command
* You hardened an externally-sourced container image by applying patches and executing hardening scripts, allowing the secure image to be used as a base image internally
* You deployed your application into production following the GitOps methodology with ArgoCD
* You set up a CI pipeline with Tekton, automating many of the tasks that were carried out in earlier exercises

I hope you have enjoyed the workshop. If you would like to further explore OpenShift in a safe (and free!) way on your time, please check out the following resources:

* [learn.openshift.com](https://learn.openshift.com/) - Interactive learning scenarios run on a pre-configured OpenShift instance
* [Developer Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox) - Instant access to your own hosted minimal, preconfigured environment for development and testing
* [CodeReady Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers) - install a slimmed down version of OpenShift on your own machine for local development and testing
* [Kube by Example](https://kubebyexample.com/) - a Red Hat sponsored initiative for learning the basics of Kubernetes by either watching or doing

Enjoy, and thank you for your time!
